This is use case data for OBD-II diagnostic bus logging.
In parallel to the device the PCAN-USB Adapter (by PACN / Grid Connect) was connected and logging performed using PcanView software. Logging to SD card was started first, so there is portion of data at the beginning which is absent in PCAN log.
Then both logs were post-processed and compared with WinMerge. You can check the screenshot WinMerge.png of comparision.
No difference has been found.
The 'Config.txt' file used to configure logger device included.
